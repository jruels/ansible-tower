# AAP - AWX CLI

## Objective

This is an advanced lab so we don’t really want you to use the web UI for everything. AAP's web UI is well done and helps with a lot of tasks, but same as in system administration it’s often handy to be able to use the command line or scripts for certain tasks.

We’ve incorporated different ways to work with AAP in this lab guide and hope you’ll find it helpful. The first step we do is install the **AWX CLI** utility.

> **TIP:** **AWX CLI** is the official command-line client for AWX and Red Hat Ansible Tower. It uses naming and structure consistent with the AWX HTTP API, provides consistent output formats with optional machine-parsable formats.





## Congrats!
